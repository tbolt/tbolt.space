I"p<p>From the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">AT&amp;T Archives: The UNIX Operating System</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The usual way to get a large computer application developed involves a big team of people working in close coordination. Most of the time this works surprisingly well but it does have its problems and large projects tend to get done poorly. They take a long time and they consume an astonishing amount of money and in many cases the individual team members are dissatisfied. So everybody in the computing business is constantly searching for ways to do a better job of developing computer applications. There aren’t likely to be any final answers both because the problems are hard and because as we find solutions we try even more ambitious objectives.</p>

<p>What a prescient quote. This still holds true today.</p>
