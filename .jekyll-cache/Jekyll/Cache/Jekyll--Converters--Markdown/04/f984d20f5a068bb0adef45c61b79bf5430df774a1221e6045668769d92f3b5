I"Ê<p>Excellent article indicting vitamin manufacturers by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/dont-take-your-vitamins.html?_r=1&amp;">Paul A. Offit of the New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking in support of F.D.A. regulation was Marsha Cohen, a lawyer with the Consumers Union. Setting eight cantaloupes in front of her, she said, â€œYou would need to eat eight cantaloupes â€” a good source of vitamin C â€” to take in barely 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C. But just these two little pills, easy to swallow, contain the same amount.â€ She warned that if the legislation passed, â€œone tablet would contain as much vitamin C as all of these cantaloupes, or even twice, thrice or 20 times that amount. And there would be no protective satiety level.â€ Ms. Cohen was pointing out the industryâ€™s Achillesâ€™ heel: ingesting large quantities of vitamins is unnatural, the opposite of what manufacturers were promoting.</p>
