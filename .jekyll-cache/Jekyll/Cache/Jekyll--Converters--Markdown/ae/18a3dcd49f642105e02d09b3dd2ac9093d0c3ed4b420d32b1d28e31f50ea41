<blockquote>
  <p>As builders, we like tools and tech because theyâ€™re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people weâ€™re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions.</p>

<p>There are good reasons to use tools when building stuff, they can speed up the process, reduce barriers, and increase enjoyment. I would be the first to admit I enjoy using the latest frameworks and tools for web development, but itâ€™s not always the right thing to do.</p>
