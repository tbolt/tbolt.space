<blockquote>
  <p>In the early 90s a young British computer scientist, Tim Berners-Lee had been tasked by CERN (Centre Europ√©een pour la Recherche Nucl√©aire the now famous large hardon collider that found the Higgs Boson or a tiny thing pretending to be it) to go in and see if he could find a way of getting the Tower of Babel of different computing platforms used by the hundreds of physicists at the plant to talk to each other. He came up with something that made use of metatextual techniques that he called The Information Mine. Being a very very modest man he realised that those initials spelled out his name, TIM, so he changed it at the last minute to the World Wide Web. He wrote a language HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), a set of communication protocols (chiefly htttp ‚Äî the hypertext transfer protocol) and an application, as we would now say, on which all these could run, which he called a browser.</p>

  <p>He planned, devised, programmed and completed this most revolutionary code in Geneva on one of Steve Jobs‚Äôs black cube NeXT computers. Hugging his close to him he took the train to Paris where Jobs was going to be present at a NeXT developers‚Äô conference. Clutching the optical disc that contained the most important computer code in history he sat at a desk while Steve marched up and down looking at hopeful programs and applications. As in all of Steve‚Äôs judgments they either sucked or were insanely great. Like a Duchess inspecting a flower show he continued along the rows sniffing and frowning until he got two away from the man who had created the code which would change everything, everything in our world. ‚ÄúSorry Steve, we need to be out of here if we‚Äôre going to catch that plane,‚Äù whispered an aide into Jobs‚Äôs ear. So, with an an encouraging wave Steve left, two footsteps away from being the first man outside CERN to see the World Wide Web. The two men never met and now, since Steve‚Äôs death, never can.</p>
