<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of the day we, as a society, have a decision to make. We can adopt the position that your data must always be accessibleâ€”first to the company that made your software and secondly to its government. This will in some ways make law enforcementâ€™s job easier, but at a great cost to industry and our own cybersecurity. It will make us more vulnerable to organized hackers and could potentially balkanize the tech industryâ€”exposing every U.S. software firm to the same suspicions that currently dog Kaspersky.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, we can accept that to protect user data, companies have let it goâ€”and the single most powerful tool technologists have developed to accomplish this goal is encryption. Software with encryption can secure your data, and in the long run thisâ€”properly deployed and verifiedâ€”can help our software industry spread competitively across the world. This will not be without costs: It will make (some) crimes harder to solve. But the benefits will be real as well.</p>

  <p>Software and service providers are not deploying encryption merely to frustrate the U.S. government. Providers know their business far better than the Justice Department doesâ€”when they choose to deploy encryption, itâ€™s because their business depends on it. And while it may be frustrate law enforcement, in this case Silicon Valleyâ€™s interests and consumersâ€™ interests are aligned.</p>
