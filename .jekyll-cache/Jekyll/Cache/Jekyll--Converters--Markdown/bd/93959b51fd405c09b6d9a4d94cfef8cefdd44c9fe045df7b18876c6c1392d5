I"‹<p>Jony Ive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the things that we were interested in doing is, despite people talked about this being â€œflat,â€ is that itâ€™s very, very deep. Itâ€™s constructed and architected visually and from an informational point of view as a very deep UI, but we didnâ€™t want to rely on shadows or how big your highlights could get. Where do you go? I mean, there is only so long you can make your shadows.</p>

  <p>It wasnâ€™t an aesthetic idea to try to create layers. It was a way of trying to sort of deal with different levels of information that existed and to try to give you a sense of where you were.</p>
