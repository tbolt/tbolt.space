I"‘<p>Here are my favorite programming language names. I tried to be unbiased and not factor in my knowledge of the language design, history, or the surrounding community.</p>

<p>Programmers are often notoriously bad at naming things, so itâ€™s no surprise that this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">list of programming languages</a> is full of boring names. Not that it really matters, but if a new language was released named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">K++#</code> I likely wouldnâ€™t pay it any attention.</p>

<p>Honorable mentions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColdFusion</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Simula</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWK</code></p>

<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>A great name for a programming language, and easily my favorite. The subtle hint that this is intended to be a systems language and â€œcloser to the metalâ€ is just perfect.</p>

<h2 id="ada">Ada</h2>
<p>The name Ada stands up on itâ€™s own. Being named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">first computer programmer</a> is just icing on top.</p>

<h2 id="lua">Lua</h2>
<p>What does Lua mean? Donâ€™t know, but I like it.</p>

<h2 id="swift">Swift</h2>
<p>I havenâ€™t used Swift enough to know if itâ€™s a truly swift programming language, but the name checks out.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/v5djol/favorite_programming_language_names#c_j8esrn">Lua means â€œmoonâ€ in Portuguese.</a></p>
