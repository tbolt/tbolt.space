<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft has just revealed its next great innovation: Windows Holographic. Itâ€™s an augmented reality experience that employs a headset, much like all the VR goggles that are currently rising in popularity, but Microsoftâ€™s solution adds holograms to the world around you. The HoloLens headset is described as â€œthe most advanced holographic computer the world has ever seen.â€ Itâ€™s a self-contained computer, including a CPU, a GPU, and a dedicated holographic processor. The dark visor up front contains a see-through display, thereâ€™s spatial sound so you can â€œhearâ€ holograms behind you, and HoloLens also integrates a set of motion and environmental sensors.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t count Microsoft out just yet.</p>
