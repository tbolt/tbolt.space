  <p>N√§nni confirmed my theory: ‚ÄúYou are absolutely right. A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our ‚Äúfovea-eye‚Äù is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Professor N√§nni is saying that rounded rectangles are literally easier on the eye. Put another way, compared to square-edged rectangles, rounded rectangles are more computationally efficient for the human brain. To me, this is a revelation. An idea that at the very least demands more investigation.</p>

<p>Rounded rectangles have been a staple of UI design since the dawn of the graphical user interface. Lately there has been an increasing number of sharp-edged rectangles used in UI designs, specifically in buttons and forms. For instance, <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#">Material Design</a> uses nearly-straight edges throughout its UI components.</p>
