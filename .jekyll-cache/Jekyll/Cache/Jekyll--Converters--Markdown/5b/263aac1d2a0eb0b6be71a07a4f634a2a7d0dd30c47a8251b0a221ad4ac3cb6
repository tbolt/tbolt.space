<blockquote>
  <p>As Nintendo exploded, there were plenty of opportunities to make a quick buck (hardware upgrades, unnecessary peripherals), exploit the companyâ€™s beloved characters (movies, theme parks), or dilute the brand by trying to attract an audience older than Nintendoâ€™s six-to-fourteen-year-olds. But these kinds of things didnâ€™t interest Arakawa. What propelled him was a desire to continually provide Nintendoâ€™s customers with a unique user experience. He set up a toll-free telephone line where Nintendo â€œGame Counselorsâ€ were available all day to help players get through difficult levels, and he initiated the Nintendo Fun Club, which sent a free newsletter to any customer who had sent in a warranty card. Both programs were very costly and could have been offset by charging small fees or obtaining sponsorship, but Arakawa believed that doing so would compromise Nintendoâ€™s mission.</p>

<p>Intense focus like this is always applaudable.</p>
