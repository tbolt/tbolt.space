I"Ç<p>There has been some <a href="https://medium.com/the-official-unofficial-firefox-blog/browse-against-the-machine-e793c0fee917">back</a> and <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/">forth</a> between Mozilla and Chrome in regards to browser market share. While Chrome has signifigantly higher market share, I found this HN comment spot on:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But I donâ€™t think Mozilla lost.</p>

  <p>I worked for Mozilla for a few years, after seeing John Lily (CEO at the time) speak. It was right after Chrome started getting popular, and a smug person in the crowd asked him about how he felt about Chrome.</p>

  <p>Johnâ€™s response was awesome. â€œThis is the web that we wanted. We exist not because we want everyone to use Firefox, but because we wanted people to have a choiceâ€ Firefox was a response to a world of â€œbest viewed in IEâ€ badges, and it changed the browser landscape.</p>

  <p>Now, we have options. Chrome is great, but so are Safari, Edge, Brave, Opera and Firefox. Thereâ€™s a lot of options out there, and theyâ€™re all standards compliment. And thatâ€™s thanks to Mozilla.</p>

  <p>So, in my mind, Mozilla won. Itâ€™s a non-profit, and it forced us into an open web. We got the world they wanted. Maybe the world is a bit Chrome-heavy currently, but at least itâ€™s a standards compliment world.</p>

  <p>I hope Mozilla sees that. I hope they take credit, and move on to whatâ€™s next: privacy and net neutrality. Our privacy is under attack, and Mozilla is one of the few companies that can (and would want to) help. I know, I know. Nobody cares about privacy. Nobody cared about web standards, either, but Mozilla bundled it into an attractive package and it worked. Itâ€™s time for Mozilla to declare victory, high five the Chrome team, and move on to the next big challenge.</p>

  <p>We really need someone to fight for our privacy and neutrality. And I really believe that this could be Mozillaâ€™s swan song.</p>
