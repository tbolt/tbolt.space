<blockquote>
  <p>Analysis was performed on the Kepler space telescopeâ€™s July 2015 planet candidate catalog, which identified 4,302 potential planets. For 1,284 of the candidates, the probability of being a planet is greater than 99 percent â€“ the minimum required to earn the status of â€œplanet.â€ An additional 1,327 candidates are more likely than not to be actual planets, but they do not meet the 99 percent threshold and will require additional study. The remaining 707 are more likely to be some other astrophysical phenomena. This analysis also validated 984 candidates previously verified by other techniques.</p>

  <p>â€œBefore the Kepler space telescope launched, we did not know whether exoplanets were rare or common in the galaxy. Thanks to Kepler and the research community, we now know there could be more planets than stars,â€ said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. â€œThis knowledge informs the future missions that are needed to take us ever-closer to finding out whether we are alone in the universe.â€</p>
