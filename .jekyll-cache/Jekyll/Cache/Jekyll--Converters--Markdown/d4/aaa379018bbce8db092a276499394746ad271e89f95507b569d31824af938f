I"æ	<p>When Apple unveiled OS X Yosemite at this years WWDC, I was pleasantly surprised with the design changes. They were practical yet refreshing and more inline with iOS 7.</p>

<p>However, after spending some time with Yosemite there is one item that I have yet to warm up to: Helvetica Neue. Changing the system font is a tall order, especially from one that has proven itself over its long span.</p>

<p>Well known typeface designer Tobias Frere-Jones <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3031432/why-apples-new-font-wont-work-on-your-desktop">claims</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite its grand reputation, Helvetica canâ€™t do everything. It works well in big sizes, but it can be really weak in small sizes. Shapes like â€˜Câ€™ and â€˜Sâ€™ curl back into themselves, leaving tight â€œaperturesâ€â€“the channels of white between a letterâ€™s interior and exterior. So each shape halts the eye again and again, rather than ushering it along the line. The lowercase â€˜e,â€™ the most common letter in English and many other languages, takes an especially unobliging form. These and other letters can be a pixel away from being some other letter, and weâ€™re left to deal with flickers of doubt as we read.</p>

  <p>Lucida Grande presents open apertures, inviting the eye to move along sideways through the text. It has worked really wellâ€“for years, and for good reason. For any text, but particularly in interfaces, our eyes need typefaces that cooperate rather than resist. A super-sharp Retina Display might help, but the real issue is the human eye, and I havenâ€™t heard of any upgrades on the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if Retina Displays help, they are really not common yet for Macs. Letâ€™s take a look at Appleâ€™s current (July 2014) Mac lineup:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup.png" alt="July 2014 Mac Lineup" width="600" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" srcset="/uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup.png 600w, /uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>Only one of the above five has an Apple Retina Display. Granted the Macbook Pro w/Retina Display is probably one of the best selling in the lineup. Still, Retina Macs are simply not pervasive. I suppose we could see new Retina Macbook Airs and iMacs, along with a new Retina Thunderbolt display this year and that would cover the whole line up, but thatâ€™s hoping for a lot.</p>

<p>It will take time for Helvetica in OS X to sink in and prove itself.</p>
