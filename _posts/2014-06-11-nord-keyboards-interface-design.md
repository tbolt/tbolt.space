[From the Nord Electro 3 product page:](http://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-electro-3)

> One of our main focuses is to have dedicated knobs and buttons for all vital functions, and keep the interface simple and easy to use during a performance. We don&#8217;t believe in submenus, and the only functions in the Electro 3 that only are available through menus are printed on the panel so you don&#8217;t need to read the manual.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t need to read the manual.&#8221;
