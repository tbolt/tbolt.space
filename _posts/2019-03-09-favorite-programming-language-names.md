Here are my favorite programming language names. I tried to be unbiased and not factor in my knowledge of the language design, history, or the surrounding community.

Programmers are often notoriously bad at naming things, so it's no surprise that this [list of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) is full of boring names. Not that it really matters, but if a new language was released named `K++#` I likely wouldn't pay it any attention.

Honorable mentions: `C` `Ruby` `ColdFusion` `Simula` `AWK`

## Rust
A great name for a programming language, and easily my favorite. The subtle hint that this is intended to be a systems language and "closer to the metal" is just perfect.

## Ada
The name Ada stands up on it's own. Being named after the first computer programmer is just icing on top.

## Lua
What does Lua mean? Don't know, but I like it.

## Swift
I haven't used Swift enough to know if it's a truly swift programming language, but the name checks out.
