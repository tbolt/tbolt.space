I was scooting around on my Apple TV after the update that brought HBO Go and I noticed that you can select a picture screensaver that randomly cycles through new/upcoming movie posters. After trying it out I realized how nice it was. Movie posters reveal a lot and having a scrolling canvas of upcoming ones is a great idea. I could see this being ideal for home theaters that like to build on the cinema experience.

Here is the setting to enable it

Here are a couple snaps of it in action
