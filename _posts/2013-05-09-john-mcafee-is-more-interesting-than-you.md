From a [slashdot article](http://features.slashdot.org/story/13/05/07/2017203/interview-john-mcafee-answers-your-questions "slashdot article") (which I recommend reading all of it):

> I haven&#8217;t been involved with McAfee Ant-virus for 21 years. When I ran the company the software was the best and least intrusive on the market, and in 1991 we had 87% of the world market. What happened after I left was none of my doing. As to name association, I am a master at sullying my own name and, all things considered, being associated with the worst software on the planet ranks way down the pole. It&#8217;s barely a blip in the ocean of associations &#8211; madman, paranoid, child molester, murderer, drug addict, unstable, liar, to name but a few.Thank god I&#8217;m 67 and will probably be too hard of hearing soon enough to have to listen to them rattling around wherever I go. Amy, thankfully, did half the job already by bursting my left eardrum when she tried to shoot me in the head while I slept back in 2011.

and

> It&#8217;s odd that people focus on the possibility that I might now be doing drugs (I&#8217;m not) and totally ignore the fact that from 1971 to 1982, 99% of my income came from smuggling and selling drugs. It&#8217;s a well documented feature of my past life. I was also taking more drugs weekly than most of you will do in a lifetime, and I was a totally indiscriminate user. Whatever came across my desk went up my nose, down my throat, in my veins or up the nether region. I never reached the notoriety of George and my writing, in comparison to him, did not merit writing books about my exploits, but we were not so totally different, he and I. I had my right testicle shattered by a hammer in 1974 when I ran afoul of some local drug barons in Oaxaca. Its the size of a grape now and shaped like a small frisbee. I have been in Mexican jails on three separate occasions and, frankly, I cannot recommend them. I was arrested in Bristol Tennessee in 1971 and charged with felony possession of a dangerous narcotic. A good lawyer got me of. (I always, oddly had tons of money that helped integrate me slightly back into humanity and smooth my transgressions).

Wow.
