One item I have been very intrigued by lately is the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Why? It&#8217;s a strange item that is so niche I wonder how it exists. However, I believe it to be a compelling product. Not only is it a gorgeous 27&#8243; IPS display with excellent color accuracy, it also [packs a number of hardware controllers.](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/09/thunderbolt-display-packs-almost-enough-hardware-to-be-an-imac/)

> With just one cable, connect any Thunderbolt-enabled Mac and get 27 inches of high-resolution screen space, high-quality audio, a FaceTime HD camera, FireWire 800 and Gigabit Ethernet ports — and a Thunderbolt port you can use to daisy-chain additional high-performance peripherals such as hard drives and video capture devices.

With the recent updates to the iMac, I can&#8217;t help but crave an update to the Thunderbolt display.

Not too often do you see a dock combined with a display. It&#8217;s a neat concept that really makes sense, and arguably the most elegant solution for laptop docking. The thin-and-light to-go machine and large home dock-in-a-display that simply extends your experience.

Let&#8217;s see an update for the Apple Thunderbolt Display with:

  * An ultrathin design similar to the Late-2012 iMacs
  * Screen-on-glass
  * A 75% Less reflective display
  * Optional Fusion Drive
  * A Couple USB 3.0 ports

I also wonder if we will see more integration with iDevices, like being able to hook up an iPad to a Thunderbolt Display would be quite interesting. Plus, following with the hardware-in-a-display model, we could see more benefits of pairing the Thunderbolt display with an iPad.

Anyone have a workstation with A MBA/MBP and a 27&#8243; Thunderbolt display? Send me some photos!
