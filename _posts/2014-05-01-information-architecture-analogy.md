[Morgan Holzer](http://morgan.holzer.usesthis.com/):

> I often equate my job to that of a building architect â€” just like they need to make sure that the floors are sound and people can walk across without hitting beams, get to an elevator and push a button and when they get off they see what they expected to see, I have to make sure that if a patron is on our website, they can understand our navigational elements and when they get to a page all of the information they need is front and center.

Great way to put it.
