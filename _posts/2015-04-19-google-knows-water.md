Benedict Evans on [Google&#8217;s evolving business:](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/4/14/what-does-google-need-on-mobile)

> <span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The key change in all of this, I think, is that Google has gone from a world of almost perfect clarity &#8211; a text search box, a web-link index, a middle-class family’s home &#8211;&nbsp;to one of perfect complexity &#8211; every possible kind of user, device, access and data type. It’s gone from a firehose to a rain storm. But on the other hand, no-one knows water like Google. No-one else has the same lead in building understanding of how to deal with this. Hence, I think, one should think of every app, service, drive and platform from Google not&nbsp;so much as channels that might conflict but as varying end-points to a unified underlying strategy, which one might characterize as ‘know a lot about how to know a lot’.&nbsp;</span>
