Fascinating article by [Ben Popper on MLB&#8217;s Advanced Media division](http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9090897/mlb-bam-live-streaming-internet-tv-nhl-hbo-now-espn):

> The latest expression of this boundless initiative is Statcast, a big data approach to sports that only a major league nerd could love. High-speed cameras and radar installed in every stadium capture the game in three dimensions and allow for real-time tracking and tabulation of each motion a player makes on the field. Fans watching an amazing replay of a diving catch can learn exactly how fast that outfielderâ€™s first step was, if he broke in the right direction, and how that compares to his historical average.

Baseball has always had a strong statistical element to it. This just takes it one step further.
