[Rain Noe:](http://www.core77.com/posts/54026/When-Bad-UI-Design-Kills-Is-Poor-Shift-Lever-Design-to-Blame-for-Death-of-Star-Trek-Actor?utm_source=public_sidebar)

> Over the weekend Anton Yelchin, the 27-year-old actor known for playing Chekov in the recent Star Trek movies, was killed in what was referred to as &#8220;a freak accident&#8221; in his Los Angeles driveway. But was it really &#8220;freak?&#8221; It seems to us that lousy design may have played a role.

> Yelchin was found crushed between his car, a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the security gate at the end of his driveway. It appears that Yelchin had exited his car and walked behind it, perhaps to close the gate, and apparently believed the transmission was in &#8220;Park.&#8221; Instead it appears it was actually in &#8220;Reverse&#8221; or &#8220;Neutral&#8221; and the car rolled down his steep driveway, killing him.

Watch the video. It&#8217;s insane how much more effort is required for the shifter. Let alone the dramatic lack of precision and feedback.
