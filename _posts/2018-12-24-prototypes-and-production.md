Great post by [Jeremy Keith on Prototyping](https://adactio.com/journal/14562), I particularly like this bit:

> Build prototypes to test ideas, designs, interactions, and interfaces …and then throw the code away. The value of a prototype is in answering questions and testing hypotheses. Don’t fall for the sunk cost fallacy when it’s time to switch over into production mode.

I'm a huge proponent of prototyping for all the reasons mentioned, but anytime a prototype morphs into the final product, it causes more headache than if we were to shelve it and start fresh.
