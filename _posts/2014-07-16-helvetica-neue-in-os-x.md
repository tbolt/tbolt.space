When Apple unveiled OS X Yosemite at this years WWDC, I was pleasantly surprised with the design changes. They were practical yet refreshing and more inline with iOS 7.

However, after spending some time with Yosemite there is one item that I have yet to warm up to: Helvetica Neue. Changing the system font is a tall order, especially from one that has proven itself over its long span.

Well known typeface designer Tobias Frere-Jones [claims](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3031432/why-apples-new-font-wont-work-on-your-desktop):

> Despite its grand reputation, Helvetica can&#8217;t do everything. It works well in big sizes, but it can be really weak in small sizes. Shapes like ‘C’ and ‘S’ curl back into themselves, leaving tight “apertures”&#8211;the channels of white between a letter’s interior and exterior. So each shape halts the eye again and again, rather than ushering it along the line. The lowercase ‘e,&#8217; the most common letter in English and many other languages, takes an especially unobliging form. These and other letters can be a pixel away from being some other letter, and we’re left to deal with flickers of doubt as we read.

> Lucida Grande presents open apertures, inviting the eye to move along sideways through the text. It has worked really well&#8211;for years, and for good reason. For any text, but particularly in interfaces, our eyes need typefaces that cooperate rather than resist. A super-sharp Retina Display might help, but the real issue is the human eye, and I haven’t heard of any upgrades on the way.

Even if Retina Displays help, they are really not common yet for Macs. Let&#8217;s take a look at Apple&#8217;s current (July 2014) Mac lineup:

<img src="/uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup.png" alt="July 2014 Mac Lineup" width="600" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" srcset="/uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup.png 600w, /uploads/2014/07/july2014maclineup-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

Only one of the above five has an Apple Retina Display. Granted the Macbook Pro w/Retina Display is probably one of the best selling in the lineup. Still, Retina Macs are simply not pervasive. I suppose we could see new Retina Macbook Airs and iMacs, along with a new Retina Thunderbolt display this year and that would cover the whole line up, but that&#8217;s hoping for a lot.

It will take time for Helvetica in OS X to sink in and prove itself.
