Google yesterday announced [Google Photos](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html) which, among other things, has an extremely impressive search feature:

> &#8230;with a simple search you can instantly find any photo—whether it’s your dog, your daughter’s birthday party, or your favorite beach in Santa Barbara.

I have only used it for a few minutes but I can already tell how incredibly useful this will be. Seems so obvious but I think this is the true way forward for photo management. Google at its finest.
