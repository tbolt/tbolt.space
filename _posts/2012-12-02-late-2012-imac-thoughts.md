Remarkably thin.

That&#8217;s the impression the first glance gave me. It&#8217;s quite an engineering achievement, and further strengthens the argument that this is the future of desktop computers.

Now this new slim design doesn&#8217;t come without sacrifice. iFixits teardown shows just how difficult it will be to do any sort of upgrades or repairs. While a batch of nerds will be upset with this, it&#8217;s clearly the right move. Apple sells a clean and complete desktop. If you need hot-swap hd bays, or easily removable RAM, look elsewhere. Id wager 90%+ of iMac owners never even consider upgrading even the RAM.

Concerning the &#8220;updated&#8221; display. It&#8217;s nice, a good upgrade but not jaw-dropping. About what you expect since its not retina. Apple claims 75% reduction in glare, which, I had a hard time distinguishing that this was true. But going back and forth from a Thunderbolt Display, the difference is clear. It&#8217;s a very nice improvement but still not on the level of matte.
