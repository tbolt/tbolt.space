[Jonas Downey:](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3752-its-ok-not-to-use-tools)

> As builders, we like tools and tech because they’re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people we’re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions.

There are good reasons to use tools when building stuff, they can speed up the process, reduce barriers, and increase enjoyment. I would be the first to admit I enjoy using the latest frameworks and tools for web development, but it&#8217;s not always the right thing to do.
