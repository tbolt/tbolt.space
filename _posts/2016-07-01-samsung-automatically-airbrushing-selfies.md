> Wow Samsung. When you get a brand new phone and go to take a selfie and realise that the default setting on the front camera is automatically on &#8220;Beauty level 8&#8221; which evidently means: seriously airbrushed face. This means everyone who gets a new Samsung phone and flicks the front camera on is automatically being told &#8220;Hi, we&#8217;re Samsung and we think you look way better when we automatically airbrush your selfies for you

Not surprising, but still somewhat disturbing that it&#8217;s the default setting.
