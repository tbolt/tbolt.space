Great excerpt from a [LWN.com article](http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/652580/ddb64b1eb568fe87/):

> Krekel quoted former Facebook researcher Jeff Hammerbacher, who said: &#8220;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That Sucks.&#8221; Instead of spending time on &#8220;getting us into space, flying cars, or whatever&#8221;, the best minds in IT are focused on how to get people to click more ads.

Web advertising has become invasive and hostile regardless of the platform. The advertising-driven business models have put reputable sites in a bad position, they either make less money or provide a better experience. This plus the above note make me think that this topic isn&#8217;t getting the attention it deserves.
