The Verge:

> It&#8217;s called &#8220;Project Loon,&#8221; and as reported last month, it involved sending up a huge number of giant balloons to beam down internet access to remote regions around the globe. Google says that balloons make sense for this purpose â€” they&#8217;re cheap to deploy and can provide wireless coverage in areas that would otherwise be difficult to serve due to geography.
