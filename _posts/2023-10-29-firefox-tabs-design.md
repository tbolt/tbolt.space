Over two years ago [Firefox launched a new design](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/new-firefox-coming-june-1/) with a change to how tabs look:
> Inspired tab design: Floating tabs neatly contain information and offer cues only when you need them, like visual indicators for audio controls. The rounded design of the active tab signals the ability to easily grab and move tabs as needed.

I'm not sure what any of that means, or why traditional tabs can't achieve those qualities. Either way I didn't like the change then and I haven't gotten over it since. They're awful. They add nothing and make the browser UI look disjointed. Firefox is a great browser but damn those tabs.
