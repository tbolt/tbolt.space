[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/technology/lawrence-tesler-dead.html):

> Lawrence Tesler, a pioneering computer scientist who helped make it easier for users to interact with computers, whether cutting and pasting text or selecting text by dragging a cursor through it, died on Sunday at his home in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 74.

and 

> In addition to helping develop the Lisa and Macintosh, Mr. Tesler founded and ran Appleâ€™s Advanced Technology Group, after which he led the design of the Newton hand-held computer, although that proved unsuccessful. The group also created much of the technology that would become the Wi-Fi wireless standard, and Mr. Tesler led an Apple joint venture with two other companies that created Acorn RISC Machine, a partnership intended to provide a microprocessor for the Newton.

Truly an icon in computing history.
