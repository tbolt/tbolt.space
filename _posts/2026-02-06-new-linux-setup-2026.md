I've ditched Windows 11 for Linux, specifically Ubuntu, and it's been a relief. I dual-booted for years, but the benefits of having an always-on Linux machine outweigh the hassles of managing and using Windows. [Linux on the desktop](https://yearofthelinuxdesktop.net) is in a great spot. The ecosystem is vibrant and it will only continue to blossom. If you're into computers, I'd argue it's the most fun option.

I don't log into this machine directly very often since I still prefer MacOS for day-to-day use. But when I do, I don't begrudge it like I did with Windows. I'm quite happy with Ubuntu and GNOME. Maybe that's boring, but it does everything I need and is extremely stable.

Gaming still works well. Steam with Proton is excellent. Valve and the folks behind Wine/Proton have done incredible work. Steam Link makes it ~~easy~~ possible to stream games to other devices in the house, particularly Apple TVs. It's actually worked better on Linux than it did on Windows. Even streaming non-Steam games has been smooth. I tested running Battle.net via Proton with Diablo IV and it worked like a charm, with zero fiddling or configuration as I recall.

For development work I still prefer MacOS and the [Nova](https://nova.app) text editor. Nova has good SSH/SFTP support, so I can connect to my Linux box and work on projects remotely, and I often do. Agent forwarding with 1Password SSH Agent means I can still use my GitHub key from the Mac. It's a nice setup.

On iPhone and iPad I use [Prompt](https://panic.com/prompt/) for SSH. It's a bit expensive and a little buggy but otherwise a great app. Plus I can VPN into my home network when I'm away. I've been tinkering with Claude Code this way, and it's a wild setup.
