[Great article from UI and Us:](http://www.uiandus.com/blog/2009/7/26/realizations-of-rounded-rectangles.html)

> Nänni confirmed my theory: &#8220;You are absolutely right. A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our &#8220;fovea-eye&#8221; is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.&#8221;

> Professor Nänni is saying that rounded rectangles are literally easier on the eye. Put another way, compared to square-edged rectangles, rounded rectangles are more computationally efficient for the human brain. To me, this is a revelation. An idea that at the very least demands more investigation.

Rounded rectangles have been a staple of UI design since the dawn of the graphical user interface. Lately there has been an increasing number of sharp-edged rectangles used in UI designs, specifically in buttons and forms. For instance, [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#) uses nearly-straight edges throughout its UI components.
