[Excellent perspective on autonomous cars by Don Norman:](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/the_human_side_of_au.html)

> But why do we make it so humans are second-class citizens? Shouldn&#8217;t it be the machines that are second-class? Shouldn&#8217;t we design by considering the powers and abilities of humans, asking the machine to pick up the remnants? This would be true human-machine collaboration.

> Note that there is a wonderful possibility for collaboration. People are especially good at patterns recognition, and dealing with the unexpected, and at setting high-level goals. People are especially bad at dealing with repetitive operations, producing highly accurate, precise actions over and over again, and at vigilance, long periods of monitoring with nothing to do until or unless some unexpected critical even occurs.

> Machines are superb at all those tasks people are bad at. So why not devise a collaboration whereby each does what it is best at. The real advantage of this is that the person can always be involved, but at a level appropriate to their abilities. When something goes wrong, the person is in the loop, cognizant of the current state, ready to act.

I recommend reading the entire article.
