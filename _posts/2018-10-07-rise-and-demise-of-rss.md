[Great post on the history of RSS](https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss.html):

>There are two stories here. The first is a story about a vision of the web’s future that never quite came to fruition. The second is a story about how a collaborative effort to improve a popular standard devolved into one of the most contentious forks in the history of open-source software development.

I still use RSS everyday. It's my preferred way of reading news. [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) for syncing and managing feeds, [Reeder](http://www.reederapp.com/ios/) for iOS, and [Readkit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readkit/id588726889) for MacOS.
