Great Article by [iA](https://ia.net/) [on icons](https://ia.net/know-how/on-icons) and their widespread use and misuse. Loved this quote in particular:

> Design is not a natural science. It’s a practice that benefits from science and measurement, yet the full quality of a design cannot be objectively assessed in theory. User tests and analytics do not replace your designers, but verify their assumptions. There is more in a product than the designer can premeditate and there is more in a design than we can measure. This “more” can only be reached when we talk to humans working with it.
