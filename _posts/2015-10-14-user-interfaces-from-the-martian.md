Territory Studio created hundreds of screen graphics for the motion picture The Martian and [they&#8217;re great:](http://www.territorystudio.com/work/motion/?p=Martian)

> As a story that is mediated by technology, hundreds of screens are employed across eight key sets, forming the lens through which the drama unfolds.
>
> Working closely with NASA, Territory developed a series of deft and elegant concepts that combine factual integrity and filmic narrative, yet are forward looking and pushing NASAâ€™s current UI conventions as much as possible.

Awesome.
