[The Verge:Â ](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7867593/microsoft-announces-windows-holographic "Microsoft announces Window Holographic with HoloLens")

> Microsoft has just revealed its next great innovation: Windows Holographic. It&#8217;s an augmented reality experience that employs a headset, much like all the VR goggles that are currently rising in popularity, but Microsoft&#8217;s solution adds holograms to the world around you. The HoloLens headset is described as &#8220;the most advanced holographic computer the world has ever seen.&#8221; It&#8217;s a self-contained computer, including a CPU, a GPU, and a dedicated holographic processor. The dark visor up front contains a see-through display, there&#8217;s spatial sound so you can &#8220;hear&#8221; holograms behind you, and HoloLens also integrates a set of motion and environmental sensors.

Don&#8217;t count Microsoft out just yet.
