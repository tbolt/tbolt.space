[Wren Lanier:](http://alistapart.com/article/the-z-axis-designing-for-the-future)

> For years weâ€™ve thought about the web as a two-dimensional space filled with pages that sit side by side on a flat, infinite plane. But as the devices we design for take on an increasingly diverse array of shapes and sizes, we should embrace new ways of designing up and down. By building interfaces using a system of layers, we solve tricky design problems, flexibly adapt to a variety of screens, and create new patterns that will point the way to future interactions.

In the words of Jim Dalrymple, &#8220;[Yep.](http://www.loopinsight.com/search/Yep "Yep.")&#8221;
