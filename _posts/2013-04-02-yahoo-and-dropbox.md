Big news today, Yahoo is partnering with Dropbox to do file attachments. Especially interesting considering Dropbox just purchased Gmail client app Mailbox. I&#8217;m going to stamp this as a Marissa Mayer move. 

Techcrunch:

> In case you’ve forgotten, Yahoo! Mail is still the No. 3 most-used mail service in the world behind Hotmail and Gmail. But the last time we checked, it was No. 1 in the United States.
