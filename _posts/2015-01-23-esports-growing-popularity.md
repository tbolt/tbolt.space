Not quite apples to apples but the League of Legends WorldÂ Championship drew an [impressive number of viewers:](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/esports/esports-editorial/one-world-championship-32-million-viewers "League of Legends Championship Viewership")

> Over 32 million fans watched SK Telecom T1 earn the Summoner&#8217;s Cup in front of a sold-out Staples Center. At peak, more than 8.5 million fans were watching at the same time.

Compared to the [NFL Divisional playoff games:](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/14/nfl-divisional-playoff-games-average-34-3-million-viewers/ "NFL Divisional Playoffs Viewership")

> The NFL announced today that the four divisional round playoff games averaged 34.3 million viewers.

I&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on Esports.
