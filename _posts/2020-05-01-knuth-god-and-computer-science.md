Occasionally I find myself down rabbit holes exploring the history of computing. Donald Knuth is often a name that comes up as his magnum opus [The Art of Computer Programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) is well known and revered in computer science and programmer circles. One such exploration led me to [his talks on God and Computer Science](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html). I haven't listened yet, but I plan to as I find it a curious topic. I also enjoyed these [lecture titles](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mit-lectures.html):
