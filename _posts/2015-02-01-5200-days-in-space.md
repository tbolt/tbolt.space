[Fascinating article on the lives of astronauts onbord the ISS:](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/12/5200-days-in-space/383510/ "5,200 Days in Space")

> Sleep position presents its own challenges. The main question is whether you want your arms inside or outside the sleeping bag. If you leave your arms out, they float free in zero gravity, often drifting out from your body, giving a sleeping astronaut the look of a wacky ballet dancer. “I’m an inside guy,” Hopkins says. “I like to be cocooned up.”

I really have a hard time imagining what it would be like in space for an extended amount of time.
